# Decentralized Quiz Competition

## Project Description
The **Decentralized Quiz Competition** is a blockchain-based application that allows users to participate in quiz competitions securely and transparently. The smart contract handles entry fees, manages the prize pool, and ensures fair winner selection by verifying participants' eligibility on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to provide a **trustless**, **transparent**, and **secure** platform for conducting quiz competitions where participants can engage with confidence, knowing that results are unbiased and rewards are distributed fairly.

## Future Scope
- **NFT Certificates** for winners to verify their achievements on-chain.
- **Decentralized Governance** for the community to vote on quiz themes, difficulty levels, and entry fees.
- **Token Rewards** for top participants to enhance engagement and promote platform growth.
- **Integration with Web3 DApps** for seamless user experience.

## Key Features
- **Secure Participation:** Users participate by submitting the entry fee directly to the contract.
- **Prize Pool Management:** Entry fees are accumulated in a prize pool and automatically transferred to the winner.
- **Fair Competition:** Ensures only valid participants are rewarded.
- **Transparency:** All transactions and results are stored on the blockchain for full transparency.
- **Owner Privileges:** The contract owner can manage quiz content and declare winners.
